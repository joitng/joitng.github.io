## failure resume ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
**failure sucks.** but, despite it sucking so much, failure has taught me a lot about myself: how resilient i am, how far i need to go and, sometimes, how i'm exactly where i need to be.

and so, welcome to a list of my professional and personal failures, rejections, and disappointments. started in june of 2020.

_does not include the many failures i experience on a near-daily basis: grades that make me feel bad, my struggles with critique, the feeling of not being liked, etc etc_

### 2020
- **Never finished the Stanford ML course on Coursera:** I could technically still finish this, but I'm so behind that I've forgotten everything I've learned so far. I think I had a hard time because I hadn't yet taken matrix algebra, and honestly, I've never really seen myself as someone who'd be good at ML. I'm going to take a shot at the Harvard CS50 Intro to AI MOOC though, with a better mindset. Wish me luck!
- **Rejected for the Grace Hopper Celebration Student Scholarship:** I do diversity in tech work out of a genuine passion for it, but some people have more passion than I do! Rather than forcing myself to "catch up", I will continue to work toward implementing initiatives that I want to see in the space.
