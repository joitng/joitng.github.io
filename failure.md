## failure resume ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
**failure sucks.** but, despite it sucking so much, failure has taught me a lot about myself: how resilient i am, how far i need to go and, sometimes, how i'm exactly where i need to be.

and so, welcome to a list of my professional and personal failures, rejections, and disappointments. started in june of 2020.

### 2021
<details>
    <summary>Dropped out of co-chairing the Canadian Undergraduate Computer Science Conference.</summary>
    <p>
        I was super excited about running this conference with one of my good friends about a year ago, but things went downhill after COVID-19 forced a change of plans. We felt like we just had to let go, because our hearts weren't in it anymore. Also, I am so burnt out from this past year.

    <summary>Rejected/not considered for 2/3 of the summer research internships I applied for.</summary>
    <p>
        You only need 1 yes!!! To be honest, this isn't a huge failure and I was considering not adding this to this list; I was rejected from the CMU HCII REU program and was not considered for the MSR REU because I had already received and accepted an offer from the UWaterloo Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program.

### 2020
<details>
    <summary>Got a C+ in Calculus 3</summary>
    <p>
        The worst course grade I have ever received. What I learned (or was reminded of): 
        1) Always make sure to thoroughly study concepts you feel shaky on. 
        2) A basic understanding needs to be supplemented with practice, at least for math classes. 
        3) Don't take 2 math classes at the same time, especially during a pandemic. 
        4) You can enjoy (academic) things you're not necessarily good at.

    <summary>Never finished the Stanford ML course on Coursera</summary>
    <p>
    I could technically still finish this, but I'm so behind that I've forgotten everything I've learned so far. I think I had a hard time because I hadn't yet taken matrix algebra, and honestly, I've never really seen myself as someone who'd be good at ML. I'm going to take a shot at the Harvard CS50 Intro to AI MOOC though, with a better mindset. Wish me luck!

    <summary>Rejected for the Grace Hopper Celebration Student Scholarship</summary>
    <p>
        I do diversity in tech work out of a genuine passion for it, but some people have more passion than I do! Rather than forcing myself to "catch up", I will continue to work toward implementing initiatives that I want to see in the space.
