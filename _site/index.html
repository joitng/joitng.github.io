        </h1>
        <h4>I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia who's interested in research and, as cheesy and overused as this is, using tech for social good.</h4>
        <p>I'm currently an Undergraduate Research Assistant at UBC, supervised by Dongwook Yoon and Sidney Fels. You can find anything else you might need to know about me below.</p>
